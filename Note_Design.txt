About the things I've changed in the design :


-The play video button seems more comfortable with an hover effect on the image

-Added more contrast on the green 

-Reduce the white space and some card width




About what I think of the design :

I think it's a really cool modern design, with really interesting things like the card, and their position.
It's a very dynamic design and I've a had lot of fun to code it in HTML SCSS
